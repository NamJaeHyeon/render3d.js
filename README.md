# 3D Polygon Rendering with JavaScript
This project demonstrates the ability to render a 3D polygon using JavaScript and HTML canvas. The polygon is created using a set of vertices and rendered in a 3D space with the ability to rotate and translate.

## Motivation
-To showcase the capabilities of JavaScript in 3D graphics rendering
-To provide an interactive 3D polygon example for learning and experimentation
-To demonstrate the use of HTML canvas in web-based 3D graphics
## Principles Used
-3D geometric transformations (rotation, translation)
-3D perspective projection
-Use of HTML canvas and JavaScript
## Usage
-Clone or download the repository
--Open the index.html file in a web browser
-Use the provided controls to rotate and translate the polygon
-Experiment with the code to customize the polygon and add additional features.
## Note: This project is a basic demonstration and is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
